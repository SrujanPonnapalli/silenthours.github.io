excerpt: "In the dream, I don't tell anyone,\nYou looked at me,\nAnd the world paused,\njust for us."

In the dream, I don't tell anyone,
You looked at me,
And the world paused, 
just for us.

I wonder if you knew.

Years unfolded in seconds,
Each its own life,
Memories on an invisible canvas.

We danced through seasons,
Autumn leaves cradling laughter,
Winter's embrace warming us

Stars danced around us,
Each heartbeat a note in our symphony,
Moments folded into eternity.

And in that glance, 
the world paused,
just for us.

I wonder if you knew.
